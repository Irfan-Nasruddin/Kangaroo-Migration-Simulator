# Kangaroo-Migration-Simulator
It's just a simple implementation of graph except... kangaroos

Basically this is just an implementation of graph.
Each nodes/points is a habitat of the kangaroos.
The kangaroos can migrate to other points, consume food, resupply and look for females (cuz why not).
The females are hoes however.
They ain't loyal.
They may go away so the male kangaroos should really not let them go.
I can empathize because I've always been single up to this point(future me please don't disappoint me).
But anyways this is very simple .
Ez pz japanesy.
